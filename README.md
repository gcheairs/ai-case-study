## Overview and Origin
Founder Suchi Saria's startup Bayesian Health offers software to help hospital staff identify high risk patients. Its products evaluate health history and medical records to empower healthcare providers to take timely, life-saving actions for patients at risk of critical conditions like sepsis, deterioration, and pressure injuries.

>Motivated by a personal loss and informed by decades of academic research, **Dr. Suchi Saria** realized there was a way to harness the enormous amount of patient data available in the healthcare ecosystem to empower physicians and care team members with real-time clinical signals. Dr. Saria believes that right now, care is reactive, leading to conditions like sepsis being diagnosed too late. But it’s not the fault of our clinicians. Our clinicians are working their hardest but our system is not gearing them up for success. It’s not surprising that conditions like sepsis are missed. It’s hard to be by the patient’s bedside 24/7.  Early signs can be subtle and providers rarely have time to click through dozens of screens culling data from this encounter and past encounters to determine patient specific baselines and hunt for subtle deviations that may be anomalous.
>
>But, now is also a time when we can be building our systems for success. Interoperability rules are making it possible to stitch together a comprehensive longitudinal patient view. High quality artificial intelligence and machine learning driven systems can scan, analyze, and help focus attention to not miss critical events. The EMR provides a digital layer that spans nearly every care delivery setting and provides the infrastructure layer within which we can make care real-time, dynamic, patient and provider-context aware.
>
>Done right, care can be better, more proactive, and safer while reducing provider burnout.

## Business Activities & Competitive Edge
Bayesian's mission is to transform healthcare data into clinical insights, empowering physicians & care teams with real-time data to save lives by making proavtive care possible. By using Intelligent Care Augmentstion, they can increase the capacity of clinicians to visualize and address patient risk.

Historically, AI-driven clinical decision support models were not able to effectively monitor, tune and improve their performance over time. Due to these limitations, legacy healthAI has grown to be associated with lower accuracy, higher false-alerting rates (leading to alarm fatigue) and higher instances of over-treatment.

Bayesian directs the attention of the clinician to patients at high risk. Clinicians are encouraged to interact with Bayesian and do not feel pressure to agree with the care signals. Bayesian’s AI thinks like a clinician by considering multiple data points in concert rather than individually. Clinicians use the platform as an extra set of eyes and ears.

## Bayesian Technology
>Bayesian Health’s **Targeted Real-Time Early Warning System (TREWS)** integrates within a hospital’s Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system where it analyzes patient data, sending accurate and actionable clinical signals within existing workflows to empower physicians and care team members to catch life-threatening complications early.
>
>Developed in collaboration with researchers at Johns Hopkins University, our clinical AI application significantly improves the early detection of sepsis, a leading cause of death in hospitals.

## Major Results
- By using Bayesian's TREWS to analyze a patient’s medical records, symptoms, and lab results, the system alerted clinicians to probable cases of sepsis with a 
  ***sensitivity rate of 82%, far surpassing typical early-alert systems that operate at 20% to 30% sensitivity.***

- With high-physician adoption*, Bayesian’s real-time clinical signals drive faster, timelier treatment and better care outcomes. Recent, large outcome study 
  showed 89% physician and care team adoption, leading to 1.85h earlier treatment for sepsis.

## Recommendations
  - There is a huge opportunity in Obstetrics for Bayesian to mitigitate loss of life.  The same way TREWS uses data and medical records for Sepsis prevention, it could be used to reduce the disproportionate black maternal infant mortality rate. Black infant Maternal moratlity has increased by 30% over the last 5 years. I recommend that they look into expanding their scope of care to Obstetrics.

  - Doing so could save so many lives and open up a HUGE segment of the market that they currently aren't accessing.
  - Expanding into Obstetrics would utilize their current TREWS which analyzes a patient’s medical records, symptoms, and lab results to identify anomalies and potential risks during birth. They could use that in conjunction with Big data health analytics to identify patterns of distress. Additionally, they could leverage medical robotics and use the data collected to perform life saving procedures.
  - Laser surgeries can be minimally invasive and repair damage, while not causing harm to the unborn child.
